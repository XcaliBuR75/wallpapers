# Wallpapers
This repository contains all of the Wallpapers that I regularly use.

# Installation & Usage
The reason these wallpapers are in a Git Repo, rather than a zip file on my website, is so that they can be easily downloaded as part of an installation script, or just quickly on the command line -- to that end, a simple ``git clone https://github.com/makccr/wallpapers``, will do the trick.

```
git clone https://github.com/XcaliBuR75/wallpapers
```

### Tech Specs
All of these images use the JPG format, spelled as ``.jpg``, not ``.jpeg`` for consistency. This is just to save on the file size. I find that I don't usually notice the difference between a JPG and a PNG or other higher quality image format (in the context of a wallpaper), and JPG files have significantly smaller file size; so I hope you see what I'm getting at. 

All of the wallpapers also have a minimum resolution of 1080p; and I'm slowly replacing the lower resolution wallpapers with 4K equivalents, or removing them entirely. But, for the time being, if you're using a display with a resolution higher than 1080p you might be careful just picking any image at random. 

### Devices
It also may be relevant to note that this library includes wallpapers intended for use on mobile (portrait) & desktop (landscape) layouts. These images aren't organized in any specific way, but the largest majority of images should also be of a high enough resolution that they can be used with either type of layout without any noticeable degradation. That being said, I do primarily work on a desktop or a laptop; so the majority of the images are collected with that in mind. There are some images that were collected specifically for use on a phone, and are in the proper orientation, but those are few and far between. This is a collection of images for use primarily on old school, you know... computers!
